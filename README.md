This project was forked from https://github.com/kevin-mcmanus/NSubstituteAutoMocker to support .NET Core and .NET Standard. As I didn't see any activity for the last 3 years on GitHub (public repositories) from the original author, I created this repository. I also added a .NET Standard project to the solution and released the .NET Standard version of the NuGet package to the gallery https://www.nuget.org/packages/NSubstituteAutoMocker.Standard/

Please refer to https://github.com/kevin-mcmanus/NSubstituteAutoMocker/blob/master/README.md for documentation.
